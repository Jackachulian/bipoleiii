Norshu: Arghhh!!!
Norshu: I don't like slimes, a rich artisan like me shouldn't have to deal with them. Right, {name}?
...
{delay=2} ???: Did someone say... {delay=6}'R I C H ?'
{name}: Who's there!?
???: I am the great Xuirbo, master of economics!
Xuirbo: After hearing your words of currency, I must assume that you two are men of busisness, yes?
{name}: What are you trying to say?
Xuirbo: What I'm saying is that you two should be interested in my economic wizardry.
Xuirbo: You see, apart from being the best character in this timeline, I'm most known for being the greatest genius in math and marketing.
{name}: I recognize you! The newspaper said you broke into a store and stole cigarettes.
Xuirbo: THAT!!!... was an economic move to umm... crash the stock market... yes... yes it was...
{name}: You really think I'm going to do a business deal with you?
Xuirbo: Yes, yes I think you will.
{name}: And why is that?
Xuirbo: First of all, I'm great a business deals.
Xuirbo: Second of all, I'm the nessessary comic relief supporting character that is yet to join you.
{name}: You're terrible at pitching your ideas.
Xuirbo: Hmm... Did I mention that I've surrounded this area with many explosives, as well as the fact that I've hired 247 elite snipers to shoot you the second I call the signal?
{name}: What!?
Xuirbo: Oh, did that change your mind, {name}? After telling me I can't convince people!?
{name}: How should I know you're not lying?
Xuirbo inhales his cigarrette and presses a buttoon on a device. A bullet grazes {name}'s arm, and the pathway behind him explodes.
Xuirbo: Convinced?
{name}: What's wrong with you!?
{name}: Why would anyone go this length to perform a business deal with a random person?
Xuirbo: Economics, my friend, economics.
Xuirbo: You see, 99% of people who are dead are poor. They can't make money if they can't work.
Xuirbo: This means that rich people are usually alive.
