{name}: So we're finally here at Rogue City.
Norshu: Suprisingly, people aren't killing each other...
Norshu: At least not visibility.
{name}: The most suspicious thing I've seen so far is that it's not suspicious.
Norshu: Hey, look at that!
(He points at a suspicious-looking group of people carrying a large metal box)
Norshu: Who just carries around metal boxes like that?
{name}: I don't carrying a box is enough to be convicted for international terrorism...
Norshu: And the box says 'MECH' on it.
Lead: What?!
{name}: Okay, that's actually sus.
{name}: Let's try following them...
{name} and Norshu follow behind the people carrying the metal box.
???: Stop right there!
{name} and Norshu's arms are captured from behind by Rogue members. A guard steps out in front of them and points an axe at their heads.
???: I am Draug, guardian of Rogue City!
Draug: I hereby command you to leave immediately!
{name}: ...
{name}: Why? We're just visiting the city.
Draug: Because you are very suspicious!
